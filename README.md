# Mental Health Prediction from Text Statements

This project aims to predict mental health conditions based on textual statements using machine learning. It involves preprocessing text data, handling class imbalance, and training a Support Vector Classifier (SVC) for multi-class classification.

## Features
- Text preprocessing (lowercasing, punctuation removal)
- TF-IDF vectorization for feature extraction
- SMOTE for handling class imbalance
- Linear SVC model for classification
- Evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/mental-health-prediction.git
   cd mental-health-prediction
